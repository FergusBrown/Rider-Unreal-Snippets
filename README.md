# Rider-Unreal-Snippets

Unreal Snippets ([Live Templates](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/rider/Using_Live_Templates.html)) for Jetbrains Rider based on Alex Forsythe's [Sublime Unreal Snippets](https://github.com/awforsythe/sublime-unreal-snippets).

Unfortunately only supports ulc, ulh and ull at the moment. Will need to look at making a Rider plugin to properly support the rest.

## Installation

Import or copy Unreal.xml to your Live Templates folder under your Rider configuration directory. Find instructions on how to do this [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/rider/Sharing_Live_Templates.html).
